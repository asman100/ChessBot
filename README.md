# ChessBot
Hi, this is the Repo for the smart automated ChessBoard developed for my thesis project. It's designed to use a CoreXY gantry inspired from 3D printers to move chess piecces using an electromagnet. We detect the pieces using hall effect sensors. Anyways tbe full development journey is available in the git wiki. Files including scripts and cad files are available in the Repo.
